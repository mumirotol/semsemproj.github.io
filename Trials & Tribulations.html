<center><h2>The Trial Comes With The Tribulation</h2></center>

<justify><p>NASA, despite many successes, reputation, history, is like any other scientific organization in such fields, full of trials and tribulations, even disasters too graphic to mention. When dealing with the innerworkings of the universe and its set course to adventure all of it, mistakes are bound to happen.</p><justify>

<h3>1.Opportunity</h3>
<p>Opportunity, also referred to as MER-B or MER-1, is a robotic rover that explored Mars from 2004 to 2018, operating for 5111 sols on the planet. NASA's Mars rover, Opportunity, was suddenly engulfed by a dust storm, that is when it sent a message home saying: "My battery is low, and it's getting dark."</p>
<p>This was the last we heard from Opportunity, and despite efforts made for contact, NASA was confident that Opportunity's solar panel are damaged. So on a Tuesday afternoon in 2019, NASA sent one last message to Opportunity before declaring her dead, it said: "I'll find you in the morning sun, and when the night is new, I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing you."</p> Similarly, the Insight lander also had dust gathered on her solar panels, however she sent on final message saying: "Don't worry about me though: my time here has been both productive and serene. If I can keep talking to my mission team, I will â€” but I'll be signing off here soon. Thanks for staying with me."

<h3>2.Challenger Disaster</h3>
<p>On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger tragically disintegrated 73 seconds after liftoff, claiming the lives of all seven crew members. The shuttle broke apart at an altitude of 46,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean, near Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 11:39 a.m. EST. A congressional investigation into the incident, witnessed by millions on live television, determined that the disaster was "not survivable."</p>
<p>The recovered remains of the crew are interred at Arlington National Cemetery. Following the tragedy, President Ronald Reagan formed a commission to investigate. During the inquiry, Boisjoly and a colleague spoke out against the decision to proceed with the launch despite their concerns. The commission ultimately attributed the faulty O-rings to Morton Thiokol.</p>

<h3>3.Apollo 1 Tragedy</h3>
<p>The Apollo 1 mission, originally named AS-204, was intended to be the first manned flight of the Apollo program, aiming to land the first person on the Moon. Scheduled for launch on February 21, 1967, it was to be the initial low Earth orbital trial of the Apollo command and service module. Tragically, on January 27, 1967, a fire erupted in the Apollo 1 Command Module during a launch rehearsal test, leading to the deaths of the three astronauts onboard. Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee perished in the incident.</p> <p>Despite efforts to open the hatch approximately 5 minutes after the fire began, the astronauts had already succumbed, likely within the first 30 seconds, due to smoke inhalation and burns. Following the accident, an extensive investigation was carried out, resulting in a temporary halt to the Apollo program.</p>
