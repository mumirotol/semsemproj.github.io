    <p>In 1961, President Kennedy urged Congress to fund the space program to land a man on the moon. The mission aimed to showcase US leadership in space and outpace the Soviet Union in the Cold War space race.</p>
    <p>The Apollo program received funding leading to the successful Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. This event sparked debates on the importance of space exploration amidst other pressing national issues like civil rights and poverty.</p>

  <h2>The Brains and Tech!</h2>
  
 <p>The machines at that time could carry out hundreds of thousands</p>
 <p>of operations per second, with a memory capacity in the megabyte range.</p>
 <p>For instance, the Apollo Guidance Computer, weighing 32 kilograms, on board the Apollo 11 Command Module, had 64 kilobytes of memory and ran at 0.043MHz. The 1969 Apollo 11 mission marked the first human landing on the Moon. Subsequently,significant progress has been made in computing and electronics, notably in size reduction.</p>
 <p>The Apollo Guidance Computer featured 4KB of RAM and a 32KB hard disk.</p>
 <p>The computer onboard Apollo 11, known as the Apollo Guidance Computer, had 2048 words of memory for storing temporary data, also called RAM.</p> 
 <p>Physicist and author Michio Kaku highlighted that today's cell phones possess more computing power than all of NASA did in 1969 when it sent two astronauts to the moon. It's incredible how technology has advanced over the years.</p>
